Derya and Miriah are launching a new exhibit at the Visualiseringscenter C! The exhibit - called Data & Me - is based on a series of data physicalization workshops we designed and ran as part of a collaborative project with [Östergötlands Stadsmission](https://stadsmissionenost.se/) to engage Norrköping youth in new and innovative ways to use personal data to tell unique stories. Inspired by these workshops, we worked with the Visualiseringscenter C to design a new exhibit that captures the idea of personal data as a source of play, empowerment, and insight.  The exhibit encourages museum visitors to consider how they can collect data about themselves, and introduces several non-digital techniques for visualizing their data, including the making of data jewelry and an emergent map of Norrköping.
