Derya and Miriah designed and launched a new data physicalization workshop for kids at the Visualiseringscenter C during the annual sportlov break. The workshop -- designed in collaboration with pedagogues at the Vis Center -- has kids creating a personal data set based on a scavenger hunt at the musuem, followed by a crafting exercise where they create aliens from data and crafting supplies.
