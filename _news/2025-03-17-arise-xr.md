LiU is part of a consortium behind a successful proposal to EU Digital Europe, aiming to develop a Master's program in Extended Reality. The idea is for students to study the first and second year in two different participating universities. Our contribution will be a curriculum for a second year specialization in interactive immersive visualization. The first students will be arriving in the fall of 2027.

For us, this will mean an opportunity to bring design and engineering closer together in the subjects of AR and VR, drawing on collaborations with the MSc Design Visual Media track as well as the Media Technology and AI program. The grant provides the resources and time to do proper innovation in multidisciplinary didactics. Collaboration and student exchange with other consortium partners such as Aalto, Milan and KTH strengthens our network in the general field of extended reality.
