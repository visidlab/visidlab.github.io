On Friday, April 4th, Elias officially "nailed" his thesis after delivering a short but engaging presentation of his work. The session was well attended, with around 30 participants ranging from first-year PhD students to full professors. During his talk, Elias also gave a sneak peek of his upcoming defense, which will take place on Friday, April 25th at 13:15. Following the successful nailing, Elias was presented with the golden nail by the library, as a token of appreciation for his presentation. We're also grateful to the library for supporting and facilitating this charming and festive tradition.
