How can sound change the way we experience art? During an evening program in the exhibition Olle Bonniér – Healing the Earth, guests took part in a conversation about sonification—the scientific practice of translating visual expressions and data into sound. The discussion was led by Niklas Rönnberg together with Helena Scragg, Curator at Norrköping Art Museum.
