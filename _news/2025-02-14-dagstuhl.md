Niklas RÃ¶nnberg and Elias Elmquist took part in the Dagstuhl Seminar "What You Hear is What You See? Integrating Sonification and Visualization", where Niklas was one of the co-organizers. The seminar included many discussion topics, such as a joint design theory and framework for audiovisual data representations, and what aspects of human perception and cognition should be considered for these representations.
