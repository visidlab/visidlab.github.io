Miriah gave an invited talk at the [Living Data Conference](https://www.livingdatastudies.com/conference-2025), organized by the Design Data and Society Group in the Department of Architecture at TU Delft. The focus of the conference was to interrogate how living data concepts are entwined with the design processes that visualize and shape spaces for living. Miriah's talk was entitled "Data As ____: Exploring the Plurality of Data in Visualization Research".
