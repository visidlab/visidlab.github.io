Derya and Miriah took the Data Aliens data crafting workshops to the [Data Lab](https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/tema/temas-datalab) at LiU. We engaged our STS colleagues in activities of producing personal data, crafting aliens with their data, and discussing the potential for the workshop to engage people in critical discussions about data.
