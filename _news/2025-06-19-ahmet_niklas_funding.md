Ahmet and Niklas received funding from the Norrköping Fund for Research and Development (Norrköpings kommun) for our project "Make your voice heard: Citizen Engagement for Safety and Inclusion through Immersive Storytelling in the Dome Theater".

It is an 18-month project that officially starts in January 2026 and aims to engage young citizens of Norrköping in immersive filmmaking in the dome theater. We want to open a creative space where the youth learn immersive media tools and techniques, filmmaking, and speculative design and make movies to tell their stories sharing future visions of the city. "Make your voice heard" will yield a series of short immersive dome movies which will contribute to public discussions on democratic values, safety and inclusivity in Swedish society on a local as well as national level. The movies and the creative process will also help us explore new ways of immersive storytelling and production in the dome with both simple and low tech as well as advanced production equipment.

As project applicants from Linköping University, we teamed up with Portalen i Norrköping (Caroline Bielkhammar), Cnema (Yvonne Olofsson, Johan Mild, Johan Karlsson), and Visualiseringscenter (Anna Öst, Lisa Lindgren) in this project.
