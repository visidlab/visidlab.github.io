The anthology brings together research and experiences from the projects Disturbance free city (funded via Vinnova) and Disturbance free city 2.0 (funded via Formas), where new methods and digital tools have been developed to coordinate urban development, construction logistics, and traffic planning, and presenting these using visualization and sonification.

It is written (in Swedish) for urban planners, entrepreneurs, researchers, and decision-makers, and offers discussions on how we can design future planning processes for urban development with minimal impact on the city's flows and residents' daily lives.

The editors are Anna Fredriksson from KTS LiU, Linnea Eriksson from the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI), and Niklas RÃ¶nnberg from MIT LiU.
