abstract: "<p>This thesis explores the potential of sonification to enhance motor memory training, focusing on video game contexts where precise sequences of actions are required. By integrating auditory cues—feedback (correct/wrong indicators) and feedforward (pre-heard sequences)—into a custom-designed application, the research investigates their impact on user accuracy, efficiency, and engagement. Comparative tests reveal that sonification can significantly improve performance metrics and user experience compared to visual-only guidance. While feedforward sonification showed the highest user preference, findings underscore the role of sound design in achieving optimal results. This research offers insights for applications in gaming, education, and motor skill-intensive fields.</p>"
