abstract: "<p>Traveling by public transport can be challenging for visually impaired travelers. However, visual information can be supplemented by sonification–the use of non-speech sound to convey data. This ongoing research project aims to explore how sonification can be used to provide information to travelers at a bus stop. The distance between an approaching bus and the bus stop, as well as the position of the front and middle doors, was sonified. The sonification design used parameter mapping, and an earcon was used to indicate that the bus had arrived. The sonification design was supported by the outcome of two online user surveys, and explored through interviews with visually impaired participants.</p>"
