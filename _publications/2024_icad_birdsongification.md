abstract: " <p>Choosing whether to represent data in an abstract or concrete manner through sonification is generally dependent on the applicability of the dataset and personal preference of the designer. For supporting a visualization with a high level of abstraction, a sonification can purposefully act as a complement by giving concrete contextual cues to the data representation with the use of auditory icons. This paper presents a case study of using bird songs as auditory icons to give context to a biology visualization, and explores how additional information of the bird species can be conveyed together with the auditory icons with parameter mapping sonification. The auditory icons are used as a foundation to convey additional information of the dataset, either by creating a parametric auditory icon, or by adding an additional sonification that accompanies the auditory icon. A user evaluation was conducted to validate and compare the different sonification mappings. The results show that there is a subjective difference of how participants perceived the sonifications, where the participants preferred sonifications that had a concrete mapping design. The sonification approaches that are explored in this study have the potential to be applied to more general sonification designs.</p> "
